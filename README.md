# Network Scanner

## Overview
This script is a comprehensive network scanning tool that performs various reconnaissance tasks, including:

- *Ping Sweep*: Identifies live hosts in a given network range.
- *Port Scanning*: Detects open ports on live hosts.
- *MAC Address Retrieval*: Attempts to retrieve MAC addresses of discovered devices.
- *Service Detection*: Identifies services running on open ports using basic banner grabbing.
- *OS Fingerprinting*: Uses Nmap to estimate the operating system running on a host.
- *Network Mapping*: Provides a summary of discovered hosts and their MAC addresses.

## Features
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Multi-threaded for efficiency
- Logs results in network_scanner.log
- Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- nmap (for OS fingerprinting)

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-scanner.git
cd network-scanner


Install required dependencies:

sh
pip install socket threading subproces ipaddress platform  # If any external libraries are needed


## Usage
Run the script using:

sh
python network_scanner.py


It will prompt you to enter:
- Network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Start and end ports for scanning
